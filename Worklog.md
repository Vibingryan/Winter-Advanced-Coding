Week 1
Reviewed the use of Class in Python with Youtube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDa-Z5JzLYM)
Finished the first version of my recipe book app (I might add some more features)

Week 2
For 3 hours, I tried to play around with while and if functions while making it. I created a simple hangman game that allows players to guess the word or the letter. I created a separate word list that I would import to the main file. 

Week 3
I started watching youtube video (https://youtu.be/yQ20jZwDjTE?si=R5s7R_JyxZRangFC)that explains webscraping and learned what it is and the fundamentals behind it. I learned how to use BeautifulSoup to do the webscraping. I also tried short practice code that would get info from Pomfret School website. I am trying to use the informations I gained to create code that would get informations from the school website that could be useful.
